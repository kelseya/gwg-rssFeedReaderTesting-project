# Project Overview

This project involves a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. For this
project I wrote several new test suites and finished one incomplete test suite.
This project makes use of Jasmine for testing (http://jasmine.github.io/). The
web-based RSS feedreader makes use of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.

# Tests Included
1. Test to ensure that the allFeeds variable has been defined and is not empty.
2. Test to ensure that each feed in the allFeeds variable has a defined URL and that the
URL is not empty.
3. Test to ensure that each feed in the allFeeds variable has a defined name and that
the name is not empty.
4. Test to ensure the menu is hidden by default.
5. Test to ensure the menu visibility toggles open and closed in response to a
click on the menu icon.
6. Test to ensure that the loadFeed function is called at least on entry is in
the feed.
7. Test to ensure that each time the loadFunction is called different content is
displayed.
